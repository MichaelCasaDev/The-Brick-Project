# The Brick Project

A simple Java-based game inspired from the original "Breakout".

This game was done for a school project during my IT course with some classmates.

## What we used

- **Maven**: to manage all external packages and project compilations
- **Git**: to manage our team work project
- **Java Swing & Graphics**: to draw the entire graphic of the game
- **JSON Files**: to store levels and users data

## Notes

`This program need to be compiled and run with **JAVA 17**.`
